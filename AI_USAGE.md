# AI Usage Documentation

This project was developed with strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) and AI co-authorship using GitHub Copilot.

## AI Co-Authorship Policy
- All code, tests, and refactors were co-authored by AI (GitHub Copilot).
- Commit messages include AI co-authorship.
- README and test reports generated by AI.

## TDD Process
- Every feature was implemented using the red-green-refactor cycle.
- Initial failing tests (red) were written for all endpoints and features.
- Code was refactored and updated until all tests passed (green).
- Code and tests were kept clean, readable, and maintainable.

## Test Coverage
- All main features are covered by async pytest tests.
- See `app/tests/api/routes/` for test files.
- Run `pytest` for a full report.

## Public Release
- This repository is ready for public release.
- All AI usage is documented for transparency.
